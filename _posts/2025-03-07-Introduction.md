Greetings!

I'm Dev Ananthraj, a practicing medical professional with a deep curiosity for data science. 

I believe that the intersection of medicine and data has the power to transform healthcare, improve patient outcomes, and uncover insights that were once hidden. 

While I continue my journey in clinical practice, I'm also exploring the world of data—turning numbers into narratives and challenges into solutions.

###### Welcome to my space, where I dive into the best of both worlds — medicine and data!
